# Design Document for mdefaults

## Introduction
The `mdefaults` application is designed to manage configuration values through command-line operations. It provides functionality to retrieve and update configuration values from a source and write them back.

## Architecture
The application is structured around a command-line interface that processes commands and interacts with configuration files. The main components include:
- **Command Handler**: Processes user commands (`pull` and `push`).
- **File System**: Manages reading and writing of configuration files.
- **Configuration Management**: Handles the creation, reading, and updating of configuration data.

## Commands
### Pull
- Retrieves and updates configuration values.
- Utilizes the `pull` function to fetch updated configurations and writes them back to the file system.

### Push
- Writes configuration values.
- Utilizes the `push` function to send configuration data.

### Config
- Prints the configuration file content.
- Utilizes the `config` command to read and display the contents of the configuration file located in `~/.mdefaults`.

## Configuration Management
- The application checks for the existence of a configuration file and creates one if missing.
- Configurations are read from and written to a file using the file system component.

## Error Handling
- Errors during configuration retrieval and writing are logged.
- The application exits with a status code indicating success or failure.

## Usage
To use the application, run the following command:
```
mdefaults [command]
```
Available commands:
- `pull`: Retrieve and update configuration values.
- `push`: Write configuration values.

Ensure that the configuration file is accessible and properly formatted before executing commands. 

## Improvement Ideas

1. **Enhanced User Feedback:**
   - Implement more descriptive error messages and success confirmations.
   - Add color coding to differentiate between errors, warnings, and success messages.

2. **Interactive Help System:**
   - Create an interactive help command that guides users through the available commands and options.
   - Include examples and use cases in the help descriptions.

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Allow users to save and load configurations for repeated tasks.
   - Implement a command to list all saved configurations.

4. **Logging and Debugging:**
   - Add a verbose mode for detailed logging.
   - Implement a debug command to help users troubleshoot issues.

5. **User Customization:**
   - Allow users to customize the CLI prompt and output format.
   - Provide options for different themes or color schemes.

6. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize the execution time of frequently used commands.
   - Implement caching for repeated operations to improve speed.
